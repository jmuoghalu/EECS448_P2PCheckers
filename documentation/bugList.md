# List of Known Bugs

- If game is left open for more than 30 minutes, connection is disconnected.

- When one player disconnects/abandons, the other player isn't told about it.

- Sometimes, when a piece is able to make a double jump immediately after becoming a king piece, it will disappear from the board before the jump is made.

- Occasionally, the game will lag when the first king piece is created. 

- The "Exit" button on the game's ending screen is not able to close the server connection.

- The game board sometimes will not be positioned symmetrically within the application window.

- The "Exit" button only closes the JFrame, and is not ending the Checkers program correctly.
